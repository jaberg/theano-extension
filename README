Theano Extension
================

This project is a tutorial/Stub that extends Theano with Ops and Optimizations.
It is meant to illustrate how to add a new Op, how to provide both a C and a
python implementation, how to provide a GPU implementation, and how to write an
optimization that inserts the GPU implementation when the host supports GPU
computing.
